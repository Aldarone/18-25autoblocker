# GG auto blocker

#### Intro

Takes a list of the 5 major idiots of GG, looks at their follower lists. Generates a list of sheeple following more than one account, as well as a list of your followers that might be questionable.

This does not rank users. It doesn't look at bios, it doesn't look at hashtags. But GamerGate appears to be completely useless at figuring out github when it's not just a wiki explaining how to be shitheads, so they'll probably never read this README and figure that part out.

#### Dependancies

Requires Net::Twitter which has a huge level of crazy deps.

If you add CHSommers or Adam Baldwin back to the list of users, it's going to take a really long time to run because of API limits. Ugh. Literally the worst, Twitter. Be less annoying.

#### TODO

Doesn't actually block users yet, but creates a list of users to block.
