# GG auto blocker

#### Dependancies

Requires Net::Twitter which has a huge level of crazy deps.

If you add CHSommers or Adam Baldwin back to the list of users, it's going to take a really long time to run because of API limits. Ugh. Literally the worst, Twitter. Be less annoying.

#### TODO

Doesn't actually block users yet, but creates a list of users to block.
